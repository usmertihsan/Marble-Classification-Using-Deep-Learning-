# Marble-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-
:pushpin: It is a deep learning project that can classify 25 different marble types. It is integrated into the mobile application. The article and the data set, which includes the steps from start to finish, are shared as open source, including the codes. 


:pushpin: You can find all the details in the article.

## Abstract
In some cases, marble types can be hard to distinguish by consumers and producers. With the 
system we will develop in our project, the difficulty of distinguishing marble types, which are 
widely used in the construction industry, will be eliminated. Our project will provide 
convenience both to consumers and manufacturers within the sector.

In this project, after teaching the machine via machine learning, the types of marble with image 
recognition with a mobile application by uploading any marble photo taken with the phone's 
camera to the system. The type and information of the marble will be transferred to the user.

A consumer who is not in the construction industry and does not have detailed information 
about marble pays attention to the color and pattern of the marble when purchasing marble. It 
is quite difficult to distinguish this difference between the marbles with the human eye. This is 
also a problem for the manufacturers. Marbles, prepared during mass production, are controlled 
by the human eyes. After a while, the human eye gets tired. So, small details can be overlooked. 
At the beginning of this project, it is aimed to solve these two problems and develop an 
application that is useful for both the manufacturer and the consumer side.
